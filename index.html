        <h3>Onion prices at wholesale and retail markets in Bangladesh rose overnight today after India imposed a 40 percent duty on exports of the bulb.

            India slapped a fresh tax on onion exports on Saturday in a bid to retain stocks and thereby tame escalating domestic prices, according to a notification from the neighbouring nation's finance ministry.
